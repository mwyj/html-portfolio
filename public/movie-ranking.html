<h2>These are my top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This is a mind boggling movie that blows your mind. Rewatch at least twice to understand the movie better.</p>
<h3>In time</h3>
<p>My childhood favourtie where people gamble with their own time which determines their time they have left.</p>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>A show where one can learn from Gump to never give up.</p>
